        <p>
            I am a software engineer, recently graduated from Muhammad Ali Jinnah University.
            I have a passion for coding and enjoy working on web development projects. In my free time,
            I like to explore new technologies and improve my skills. I am also interested in video games
            that have a competetive edge, as they challenge my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities.
